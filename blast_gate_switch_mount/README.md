# Blast Gate Switch Mount

A 3d printed piece to mount a miniature snap-action switch on plastic 4" dust collection blast gates such as those sold by PowerTec and Fulton Woodworking.

The design uses the 3d model for [McMaster 7779K62](https://www.mcmaster.com/7779K62/) but this is a standard miniature snap-action switch form factor; the actual switches used are standard generic 1185RE8 / V-156-1C25 roller lever switches.
