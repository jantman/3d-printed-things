# 3d-printed-things

Collection of things I've 3d printed and might want to print again.

Files under [backup/](backup/) are backups/mirrors of things I've printed before and might want to again, even if their current hosting/location disappears. Please see the directories and/or source links for attribution and license.

Files under other directories are remixes/forks (see their README files for details, attribution, or licenses) or my own work.

Files which are my own work are licensed under [CERN-OHL-W v2](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2).
