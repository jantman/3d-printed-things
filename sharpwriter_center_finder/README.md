# SharpWriter Center Finder

A "center finder" jig for marking the center of boards, sized to fit a PaperMate SharpWriter pencil.

I bought one of the plastic center finder and offset marker jigs off Amazon, for something like $4 USD. Sure, it won't help me get more accurate with the _real_ carpenter's tricks for finding the center of a board, but it seemed like a useful aid. That is, until it showed up and I realized that it would only fit a normal (i.e. office/\#2) pencil. I have carpenter's pencils, inexpensive PaperMate SharpWriter pencils, and a nice mechanical drafting pencil... but no "normal" pencils.

Since it makes the most sense (out of what I have) for drawing a crisp, thin, accurate line... and they seem quite popular among woodworkers and makers... this is a similar center finder designed with [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) and availble as a STL file for 3D printing, but designed to work with PaperMate SharpWriter pencils.
