# keyboard-cover

This is a replacement cover / "roof" for my pair of now-discontinued Leopold FC200RT/KB "tenkeyless" mechanical keyboards (note that from product photos, these look identical to the current Leopold FC750R series).

They're not exact reproductions of the original plastic covers, but close enough for my purposes.
