# Neopixel Mounts

Various 3d printer mounts for Neopixels and similar LEDs

## Adafruit 2855 LED Ring Lens Mount

`adafruit-2855-lens-mount` - A spacer that fits the 31.75mm ID on the [Adafruit 2855 NeoPixel Ring - 16 x 5050 RGBW LEDs w/ Integrated Drivers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2855) and adapts it to fit over the 28mm OD of the LS-2717CS lens included with the [Arducam B0032 5MP OV5647 Camera Module with CS mount Lens](https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-5mp-cs-mount-camera-module-raspbery-pi/). Allows the Neopixel ring to just slip over the barrel of the lens. Snaps very nicely into the center of the Neopixel ring, but may need a few pieces of electrical tape on the ID to shim for a sliding fit on the lens.

## Adafruit 2868 NeoPixel Mounting Bar
