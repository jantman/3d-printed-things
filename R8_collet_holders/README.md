## R8 Collet Holders and Similar

Some R8 collet holders and related things intended to sit in a drawer and connect together with dovetails.

These designs are based on a modified version of the collet design from [R8 Collet by kdtop3 - Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4106427) used to get the dimensions of the collet to subtract from the holder design. This design was largely inspired by [R8 collet or endmill holder by winegummo - Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4595041). The dovetail module is [Dovetail modules for openscad by jag - Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10269).
