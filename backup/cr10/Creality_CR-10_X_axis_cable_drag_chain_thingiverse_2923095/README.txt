# Summary

Update 04 Nov 19: Revised X bracket design providing a short support tray for chain links - providing extra support particularly when the hotend is more to the right of the printer. (X bracket v11)

Update 21 June 18: Revised X bracket design providing more rigidity over the previous design and a small space for any cable bundle that is needed.

X Axis drag chain to compliment Y and Z axes drag chains (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2757810 and https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2708420)

Drag chain assembly for CR-10 to manage cabling from the hotend (heater, thermistor and 2 cooling fans) . Works only with cable extensions kits.

Integrates with Z axis draft chain, with a combination XZ bracket attached to the left hand Z rail carriage.

Requires:

2x M5 50 mm bolt and nylon lock nuts
zip ties to hold cable to top and bottom brackets.
Upgraded chain links (compatible with Z axis drag chain) but with reduce angular rotation to increase minimum assembly diameter. Not compatible with Y axis chain links.

The picture shows an alternative cooling fan assembly however it does fit with stock cooling fans.

Print:
10x bottom links (100% infill)
10x top links (100% infill)
1x X bracket (100% infill)
1x vert combo bracket (100% infill)
