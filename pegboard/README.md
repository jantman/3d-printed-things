# pegboard

A collection of holders for pegboard.

These are based around [cilynx's Parametric Pegboard Base from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2583402).

* ``ruler_holder`` - A little multiple shelf-type-thing to hold rulers and other long thin objects.
* **Broken:** ``cutter_holder`` - A holder for small electronics-type cutters/end nippers. This is based on [thingiverse 4950608](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4950608). Note that this model is broken; the triangle that forms the support and the triangle in front of it are actually separate planes, and print disconnected.
