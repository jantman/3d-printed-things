# Limit Switch Brackets

Some generic brackets for mounting common limit switches.

In general, the switches we're talking about here are:

* **mini(ature)** - Common miniature limit switches such as the generic V-156-1C25; these switches have a body that's 1.09" (27.68mm) long, 0.63" (16mm) tall, and 0.41" (10.41mm) wide with 0.12" (3mm) diameter mounting holes at opposite corners. The mounting holes are spaced on center 0.88" (22.35mm) apart length wise and 0.41" (10.41mm) apart height wise. A good example of this part, including 2D drawings and a 3D model, is [McMaster 7779K62](https://www.mcmaster.com/7779K62/) but this form factor is widely available through electronics suppliers, Amazon, etc.
* **submini(ature)** - Another common form factor of snap-acting switches, usually termed "subminiature". These come in a package that is 0.79" (20mm) long, 0.40" (10.2mm) tall, and 0.26" (6.4mm) wide with a pair of 0.1" (2.5mm) diameter mounting holes next to each other near the bottom edge of the switch, spaced 0.37" (9.5mm) apart on center. Again, these are widely available standard sizes, but [McMaster 7658K15](https://www.mcmaster.com/7658K15/) has 2D and 3D models of this form factor.

## Brackets

* `mini_yz` - A tall L-bracket for the mini switches, with mounting screw slots for adjustment in the Y and Z axes.
* `submini_yz` - A tall L-bracket for the submini switches, with mounting screw slots for adjustment in the Y and Z axes.
